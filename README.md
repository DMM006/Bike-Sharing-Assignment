# Multiple Linear Regression: Bike Sharing Assignment
### Introduction
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

## General Information
- This analysis highlights the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Loan Data Set
- Various EDA and data modelling process as been carried for bike sharing dataset such as
    - Data Sourcing
    - Data cleaning
    - Univariate analysis
    - Bivariate analysis
    - Derived metrics
- Various visual graphs such as matplotlib and seaborn are used for Exploratory Data Analysis
- The Problem Statement is as follows

-  model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

- Seaboarn

## Conclusions
The analysis presented above is related to Bike Sharing data Set. 
- The aim of this analysis to reduce the loss percentage of Consumer Finance Company by providing the loan to loan applicants
- This detailed analysis of loan dataset using EDA addresses the two key challeges 
    - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
    - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The analysis presented above, identifies the number of Good_loan and Bad_loans using various EDA process and, also identify the staticstics to approve Full loan and Defaulted loan based on the loan applications. 
- Hence, by identifing staticstics to Full approved loan and dfaulted loan, reduces the loss percentage for the Finance Company
